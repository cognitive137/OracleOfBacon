<br />

## Project Description

Simple Application of Breadth First Search (BFS), a classic graph search algorithm. Used JavaScript to model BFS in a graph.

<br />

## Use

- Enter the names of the actors in the kevinbacon.json file, be sure to follow the same format for other actors as well if you wish to increase the dataset.
- Please enter only the name of the actors who are present in the JSON file.

<br />

## Demo:

See index.html page for a working example.

<br/>

## Working mechanism

- Each node consists of properties edges, parent, `searched` flag and value.
- Root node has parent null.
- Subsequent children have previous node as parent.
- BFS algorithm traverses this graph.
- If searched value found during traversal, report it.
